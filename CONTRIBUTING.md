## Technical Documentation

### Visual Design System

#### Node Sizing
- **Uniform sizing approach**: Node size indicates hierarchy level, not job count
- **Root node**: 20px radius (OnlineJobs.ph)
- **All other nodes**: 12px radius (consistent across all skill levels)
- **Font sizes**: Scale with hierarchy (24pxâ†’18px desktop, 20pxâ†’16px mobile)

#### Color System
The visualization uses a sophisticated category-based color scheme with 7 distinct skill categories:

- **ðŸ”µ Technology/Programming**: `#0066FF` â†’ `#00BBFF` (blue gradient)
  - Programming, Web Development, Mobile Development, Cloud Services, etc.
- **ðŸŸ£ Design/Creative**: `#9B59B6` â†’ `#E74C3C` (purple to red)
  - Design, Graphics, UI/UX, Video/Audio Editing
- **ðŸŸ  Business/Management**: `#FF6B35` â†’ `#FFB700` (orange gradient)
  - Business, Management, Finance, Accounting, HR
- **ðŸŸ¢ Marketing/Sales**: `#00C896` â†’ `#00E676` (green gradient)
  - Marketing, Sales, SEO, Social Media, E-Commerce
- **ðŸ”· Writing/Content**: `#00ACC1` â†’ `#26C6DA` (cyan gradient)
  - Writing, Content, Copywriting, Blog
- **ðŸ”® Data/Analytics**: `#3F51B5` â†’ `#7986CB` (dark blue gradient)
  - Data, Analytics, Research, Statistics
- **ðŸ©· Support/Admin**: `#E91E63` â†’ `#F06292` (pink gradient)
  - Support, Admin, Customer Service, Virtual Assistant

Color intensity within each category increases with job count (0-200 jobs range with HSL interpolation).

#### Job Demand Indicators
Special border effects highlight high-opportunity skills:

- **High demand (50-99 jobs)**: Magenta border (`#FF00FF`), 3px width, pulsing animation
- **Very high (100-199 jobs)**: Cyan border (`#00FFFF`), 4px width, faster pulsing
- **Ultra high (200+ jobs)**: Rainbow gradient border, 4px width, color-cycling animation

### Layout Modes

#### Radial Layout
- Circular tree radiating from center
- Size: `[2Ï€, min(width,height)/2 - 150]`
- Simple separation: siblings 1x, non-siblings 2x/depth

#### Horizontal Layout (Default)
- Traditional left-to-right tree structure
- Size: `[height Ã— 1.5, width - 200]`
- Sophisticated spacing with depth factors:
  - Level 1: 2x spacing
  - Level 2: 2.5x spacing
  - Level 3+: 3x spacing with additional multipliers
  - Nodes with children get 1.3x extra space

### Interactive Features

#### Navigation
- **Click nodes**: Expand/collapse branches (+ = expandable, âˆ’ = expanded)
- **Click leaf nodes**: Opens OnlineJobs.ph job search for that skill
- **Zoom/Pan**: Mouse wheel or touch gestures
- **Reset View**: Returns to optimal zoom level for current layout

#### Search & Filtering
- **Text search**: Find specific skills with pink highlighting
- **Job count filter**: Slider to show only skills above minimum threshold
- **High opportunity toggle**: Show/hide special border effects

#### Tooltips
- **Desktop**: Hover to show skill details
- **Mobile**: Long-press (500ms) to display tooltip for 3 seconds
- Shows job count, hierarchy level, and category totals

### Mobile Experience

#### Responsive Design (768px breakpoint)
- **Hamburger menu**: Slide-out controls with overlay
- **Touch optimization**: 44px minimum touch targets
- **Collapsible sections**: Legend and instructions fold away
- **Font scaling**: Reduced sizes for mobile readability

#### Touch Interactions
- **Tap**: Expand/collapse or navigate to jobs
- **Long-press**: Show tooltip
- **Pinch/zoom**: Navigate the visualization
- **Touch feedback**: Visual highlights and animations

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install uv (if not already installed)

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or using pip
pip install uv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. Scrape Job Data (Optional)

The scraper supports parallel processing for faster execution:

```bash
# Test mode - scrapes only 10 skills
uv run python job_scraper_enhanced.py --test

# Full mode with default workers (uses all CPU cores)
uv run python job_scraper_enhanced.py

# Specify number of workers
uv run python job_scraper_enhanced.py --workers 8

# Custom options
uv run python job_scraper_enhanced.py --workers 4 --delay 2.0 --limit 50
```

**Command-line options:**
- `--test` - Test mode, scrapes only 10 skills
- `--workers N` - Number of parallel workers (default: CPU count)
- `--delay N` - Delay between requests per worker in seconds (default: 1.5)
- `--limit N` - Limit number of skills to scrape

**Performance improvements:**
- With 4 workers: ~4x faster
- With 8 workers: ~6-8x faster
- Test scrape (10 skills): ~7-10 seconds
- Full scrape: ~10-15 minutes

### 4. View the Visualization

Start the local server:
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

Open http://localhost:8000/index.html in your browser. The visualization will:
- Load `skills_with_jobs_current.json` if available (real job data)
- Fall back to `allskills_tree_clean.json` (demo data with mock counts)
- Display data status in the controls panel

## Data Structure

The enhanced JSON includes real job counts:

```json
{
  "Accounting": {
    "children": {
      "Quickbooks": {
        "id": "7",
        "job_count": 336,
        "type": "leaf"
      },
      "Financial Accounting": {
        "children": {...},
        "total_jobs": 245,
        "type": "branch"
      }
    },
    "total_jobs": 734,
    "type": "branch"
  }
}
```

## Output Files

- `skills_with_jobs_current.json` - Latest enhanced tree data
- `skills_with_jobs_[timestamp].json` - Timestamped backups
- `job_scrape_details_[timestamp].csv` - Detailed scraping results

## Browser Compatibility

Works best in modern browsers supporting ES6 and SVG:
- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari

## Development Tips

- Run scraper periodically to keep job data current
- Use horizontal layout for detailed exploration
- Use radial layout for overview and pattern recognition
- Filter by job count to focus on viable opportunities
- Mobile experience optimized for touch navigation

- Be respectful and constructive
- Assume good intentions from others
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Celebrate contributions of all kinds
