  "job_overview": "Hello there,\n\r\nI currently own 1 dropshipping website where I sell watches, chains and rings. I want to have more returning customers, so that's why i'm looking for someone who is experienced in making well performing email campaigns + flows.\n\r\nI currently have a 9k+ active client base on my Shopify store. This should be enough to generate some sales from your emails. I mainly focus on advertising the watches, which are priced between $59 - $129.\n\r\nThe current percentage of revenue from emails and flows is 11%.\n\r\nI'm willing to pay 25% of the revenue that you make on every email campaign. I will pay 15% for every flow, except the welcome flow.\n\r\nI'm currently working on Klaviyo, so if you have experience with the app it would be really great. The communication will be done on Slack.\n\r\nIf you can make good performing ad campaigns + flows, and are willing to work with me, feel free to leave me a message! When applying, send me some emails you have made for other people/brands.\n\r\nGreetings from,\r\nJJ",
