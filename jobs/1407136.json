  "job_overview": "Outbound Sales Closer / Base Pay + Commission\r\n===========================================\n\r\nWe hire for relentless grit and clear thinking, not years of experience.  \r\nIf you can hunt your own prospects, keep conversations alive, and close deals—mostly through messaging but ready to pivot to whatever channel moves the sale forward (voice note, video, phone)—read on.\n\r\n### Pay  \r\n• **Base pay:** fixed monthly salary.  \r\n• **Commission:** up to **100 %** on every new customer you close—uncapped.  \r\n• Commission is transferred shortly after each verified sale via Wise, PayPal, or your preferred method.\n\r\n### Work  \r\n• Find and qualify your own leads—no lists provided.  \r\n• Engage prospects primarily via DM; switch to any medium that gets the “yes.”  \r\n• Keep short notes on each conversation—results matter; hours don’t.  \r\n• All project communication will be on Instagram after hiring.\n\r\n### Culture  \r\n• Meritocracy driven by numbers and evidence.  \r\n• Continuous self-education in persuasive writing and psychology is expected and supported.\n\r\n### How to Apply — every item is required  \r\n1. **Hard-problem example**  \r\n   Describe the toughest challenge you tackled over weeks or months and the exact steps you took to solve it.  \r\n2. **Personal obstacle**  \r\n   Share a real-life situation outside of work (dating, sports, etc.) where persistence turned repeated rejection into success.  \r\n3. **MBTI breakdown**  \r\n   Provide your Myers-Briggs type with the percentage for each letter (take the free test at Upgrade to see actual info).  \r\n4. **Learning approach**  \r\n   Explain how you quickly learn the ins and outs of a brand-new product and its buyers without formal training.  \r\n5. **Instagram handle**  \r\n   Give your Instagram username. If we like your application, we will reach out there to schedule an interview.\n\r\nApplications missing any item are deleted unread.  \r\nShow your thinking process—résumés are not reviewed.\n\r\nJoin us and become the strongest closer you know.",
