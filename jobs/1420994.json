We encourage innovative thinking and fresh ideas to keep us ahead of the curve.\n\nCollaboration and Reporting: You'll work closely with our sales and marketing teams, providing regular updates on campaign performance, sharing insights, and collaborating on new strategies. Clear communication and a collaborative spirit are key!\n\nStaying Ahead of the Curve: The digital advertising landscape is constantly evolving.

Show us what you can do to help Unity Home Offers reach new heights.\n\nClarification on \"Virtually Doing Business in California\" for the Team and Role:\n\nFor Unity Home Offers as a business, \"virtually doing business in California\" means:\n\nLegal Presence: The company is formally registered and compliant with all California state business requirements. This includes having a valid California business address (which can be a virtual office address that meets specific criteria, not just a P.O. Box), a registered agent in California, and fulfilling all necessary state and local licensing and tax obligations.\n\nClient Base: Our primary client base and real estate operations are focused within California.\n\nTeam Collaboration: While individual team members, like this Meta Ads Specialist Manager, can be remote, the overall team operates cohesively as a California-based entity, utilizing virtual tools and communication to achieve shared goals.\n\n\nFor the Meta Ads Specialist Manager role:\n\nRemote Work: The role is designed to be performed remotely, meaning the individual does not need to physically reside in California.\n.\n\nThis clarification highlights that while the company has a firm legal and operational base in California, the employee can work remotely, making it clear for potential applicants where they fit into the broader picture.",
