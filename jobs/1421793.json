I don’t have the time to sort it out myself and need a reliable expert who can jump in, spot what’s wrong, and get things back on track.\n\r\nThis is a remote, short-term gig — probably just a few hours of work for someone who knows their way around Deskera.\n\r\nYou should have:\r\n- Solid experience with Deskera, especially with bank reconciliation\r\n- A good eye for detail and accounting basics\r\n- The ability to work independently and explain things clearly\n\r\nIf this sounds like something you can help with, I’d love to hear from you!",
