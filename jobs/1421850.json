Position Details:\r\n- Part-time to start: $650/month ( happy to raise fast if see proven results quickly)\r\n- Potential to scale to $1500-$3000 if results bring in high \r\n- Remote, flexible schedule — but you’ll be expected to hit weekly targets\r\n- You’ll be working with a content team and assistants already in place\n\r\n? DO NOT APPLY IF:\r\n- You have no proven experience or screenshots of past IG growth\r\n- You’re unfamiliar with managing viral reels or support accounts\r\n- You’re unsure what IG farmers are or how to use them for reach\n\r\n????
