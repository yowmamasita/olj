Please only apply if you can do the above to a good standard.\n\r\nYou will be asked to:\r\n- Design logos\r\n- Mock-up websites from a brief\r\n- Build Wordpress websites from a mock-up using a page builder\r\n- Edit wp websites\r\n- Do responsive styling audits and make the site look good on all screen sizes\r\n- Build basic low budget websites from brief alone (design in browser) \n\r\nWe will accept those that work in their own time-zone, but would prioritise someone that will work in our time-zone either 9-5 London time, or partial cross over with our UK team 4-12. This would be 11:00 - 19:00 Manilla Time.\n\r\nIf you've read this then please include in your application, how experienced you are with Oxygen Builder - our favourite builder plugin. Don't worry if you haven't used it yet - it is very similar to page bakery and elementor",
