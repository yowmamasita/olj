  "job_overview": "Hello! \n\r\nI need someone in my team who can create all my thumbnails with programs like OpenArt.AI, Midjourney or Canva. I will give you example channels and of course my own channel for inspiration. It's up to you to use your own creativity. I simply have no time for it at this Upgrade to see actual infont, and therefore i want to outsource it. \n\r\nNormally i'm busy for around 10-30 minutes with 1 thumbnail. My channel is growing and i'm aiming for 10-14 thumbnails a week within a month. Now i'm sitting 1 thumbnail a day because i'm optimizing this channel which takes some time. \n\r\nMonthly payment or weekly based on 100$ per month\n\r\nExample channels which thumbnails you need to copy or improve.\n\nUpgrade to see actual info\nUpgrade to see actual info\n\r\nBONUS: If the CTR with semi viral/viral videos above 40k views are above 7.5%.  You'll get a bonus of 15$ per thumbnail.\n\r\nAdditional preference: I'd like to work with someone who is able to do more tasks for this channel in the future. Like script writing and doing the voice-overs (with AI tools), and maybe when everything is running smoothly and doing well, someone who is able to manage the whole account with all the tasks is the main goal.",
