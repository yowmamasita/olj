  "job_overview": "**READ BEFORE APPLYING**\n\r\nWe’re looking for a skilled video editor with an already strong foundation — but just as important as your editing ability is who you are as a person. Please only apply if the following describes you:\n\r\n1. You work hard.\r\nWe don’t tolerate laziness. If you’re not committed to putting in real effort, this isn’t the right fit.\n\r\n2. You’re always improving.\r\nI’ll give feedback, but you should also take initiative to level up your edits over time. Higher quality = better opportunities and higher pay.\n\r\n3. You can accept and apply feedback.\r\nI have a specific vision and high standards. You need to be coachable and open to adjustments — not defensive.\n\r\n4. You deliver on time.\r\nIf you say something will be done today, I expect it today. Don’t push things to “tomorrow.”\n\r\n5. You work fast and efficiently.\r\nEven for longer videos (up to 10 minutes), I expect quality results within 48–72 hours.\n\r\n6. You choose the right footage.\r\nDon’t just fill space. Use clips that feel natural, real, and actually help sell. Avoid anything fake, cringey, or out of place.\n\r\n7. You’re responsive.\r\nReply quickly. Keep me updated. If something is delayed, say so in advance — not after the deadline.\n\r\n8. You’re open to multiple revisions.\r\nThis isn’t about one draft and done. Expect to revise. Each edit should bring you closer to the brand style and tone I’m looking for.\n\r\nIf that sounds like you — and you're willing to grow, stay responsive, and align with my vision — then I’d love to see your work.
