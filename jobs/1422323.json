I run a small children's book publishing company, so the majority of the work will include creating graphics around the book covers and characters, such as FB and IG graphics, bookmarks, promotional materials etc.\n\r\nSince elements from the books will be used in the graphics, access to Photoshop is a MUST. \n\r\nMust be technologically SAVVY with lots of graphic design experience. We all work hard and move fast. There are strict deadlines for everything. \n\r\nWhile this position will begin with 10-20 hours per month, I love to keep my VAs around for years, so this has the potential to become a long-term arrangement.  So this is a GREAT job with a growing amount of work available, but you must be willing to commit and go all-in 100%!\n\r\nIf this sounds like you, reply to this job post with a link to a video that makes you laugh.",
