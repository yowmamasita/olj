  "job_overview": "I'm seeking a sports graphics designer for three types of work: (1) creating images from existing templates I provide, (2) designing custom graphics based on existing template styles, and (3) developing brand new templates from scratch.\n\r\nYou'll be working primarily in Photoshop to handle everything from quick template customizations (player stats, game highlights, roster announcements) to completely original template designs. The work involves typical sports graphics elements like team colors, player photos, statistics overlays, and dynamic layouts for various social platforms.\n\r\nLooking for someone excited about sports design who can work efficiently across all three project types while maintaining high visual standards. This is an ongoing opportunity with growth potential as we expand our template library.\n\r\nFor consideration, please share a link to your sports graphics portfolio and number of hours you are available to work each week. Thank you.",
