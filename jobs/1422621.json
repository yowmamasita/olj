  "job_overview": "Hi! We are a China-based sourcing and dropshipping fulfillment center. We are looking a role to participate in our team as a role of VA or Admin support. I need this role to:\n\r\n1. Collect drop shippers leads everyday by gathering their contact information, pain point, and if necessary communicate with them before sending leads to us.\r\n2. Feedback updating information about drop shipping, like shopify sellers, to us on a week/monthly basis.\r\n3. Some other works related to this.\n\r\nI need you to be very detail-orientated, creative, eager to find customers demands and solve it. If you have experience with dropshipping and served for dropshippers before that'll be great, means you know whether to find them and how to offer valuable service to them. \r\nThis can be a very long term and full job role if we can work good together, plus salary can talk after test period, but to begin we prefer to start with part time and see if this is going to be good.\r\nThank you for your time!\n\r\nBegards\r\nCong",
